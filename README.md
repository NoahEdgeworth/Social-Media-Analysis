# Social-Media-Analysis

Thank you for checking out my mock analysis for social media usage. This project is beginner-level and uses SQL queries to analyze the data set and draw results and insights.
Speaking of the data, I got it from Kaggle.com, the link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/social-media-usage-datasetapplications/data.

## Overview
This project is using mock data of 1000 users on various social media apps and tracking their likes, follows, posts, and minutes spent per day on the said apps. This analysis could be used by marketing teams to see what apps and types of engagement lead to the most impressions and get the most value out of their ads.
